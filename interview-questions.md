# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: so a paramenter is the scope of your function essentially, and the argument is what you are using in your function to compare against? if thats a good way of putting it, thats how i remember it at least

Researched answer: the best answer i could find to explain this, and helped me understand it better was that the parameters are the aliases for the values inside the function and the arguments are the actual values.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: so I am VERY FAMILIAR with this after spending abvout 5 hours on the third question of the code challenge questions........... 
you need a function, im not sure if that is considered a parameter though... element is the first which is required, index is the second and is optional, and the last is array which is also optional.

Researched answer: so I had all of them essentially correct but there is another optional thisValue that I assume it used with objects? im having trouble finding specific instances of this, so i assume it use scarcely used.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: from what i remember, .map iterates through an array and returns an array of the same length. and .filter only returns values that meet a specified condition, so not necessarily of the same length in return.

Researched answer: i was spot on on this one, map returns an array that has the same length as the original and filter removes the elements that dont belong after the conditions are met

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: in simple ways of thinking iteration is acting on a function over the values within the function. 

Researched answer: performing an action however many times is needed in order to meet the condition specified within the function

5. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: functions are written code to perform actions, and methods are held within functions as objects to be called on.

Researched answer: i was actually pretty close with this one, methods are still functions they just exist inside of functions as properties

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: i cant even going to pretend like i know what this means, i honestly dont even have a best guess. something with lifting? like making something easier to access in some way?

Researched answer: im finding its essentially javascripts defualt way of moving declarations to the top for access.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Classes: classes look like more in depth functions that have a different scope... amazing, i barely understand the scope of old functions..

2. Spread operator: it lets us see the parameters within an array? im not sure im not finding a lot of good examples on this.

3. React state: data storage variable that chooses how a value acts.

4. React props: properties, allow the passing of data between components

5. DOM events: a signal that lets you know something is happening? this one is confusing and hard to find an actual definition for.
